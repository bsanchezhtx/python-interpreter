# python-interpreter
Python interpreter written in C++. Code heavily adapted from https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html

Can be built using the `make` command, then run with either of the following
- `./mypython` to run the interpreter in 'repl' mode
- `./mypython {python_file_path}` to interpret a python script
